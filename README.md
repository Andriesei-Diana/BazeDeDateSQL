## BazeDeDateSQL

I had the opportunity to use my knowledge of databases in these mini-projects.
We built a database structure and performed important operations such as inserting data, reading data, updating existing information, and deleting data.
This experience helped me develop skills in using database systems and gain confidence in handling data in a controlled environment.
